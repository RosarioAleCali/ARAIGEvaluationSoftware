# ARAIGEvaluationSoftware
The ARAIG Evaluation Control Software  is a C++ program that I have developed as a project for my BTP305 class (Object-Oriented
Software Development Using C++) at Seneca College during Fall 2016. 

The program is heavily based on OOP principles and strong user 
input validation. The program reads raw data from three different configuration files and then it initializes objects dynamically 
into STD Containers. Once all the objects are loaded a simple CLI menu is displayed, the CLI will be cleared each time an user 
chooses an option (Only on Linux-based systems). The menu options will provide features to users such as exectuting fligth plans, 
show the completed tasks and show the next one on the list.
